# Verloren_Companion_DiscordBot
# A Discord Bot that acted as a companion for a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign I ran during 2020. The bot is able to connect to Google Sheets to read and alter data there.

All appropiate tokens and credentials have not been included. In order for this code to work, Google Sheets API Auth Services need to give authority to access in the form of credentials. The Discord API services must also give you authority to access the bot's account through a unique token.

This bot can connect to Google Sheets to extract (in theory) large amounts of data that are hard to organize in code. These google sheets examples can be found here:
